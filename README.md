I’m interested in financial technology ("fintech"). 

  - I am currently putting together my portfolio website as I pivot from my legal career into tech. (🦉 I have said yes to sleepless nights!!)

  - I have been coding since I was a teenager and building a lot of fun projects along the way which I hope will drive financial inclusion. I love the process of designing and building products that are able to drive social and economic change.
  -💞️ I am deeply passionate about making a social impact in the world. This passion often comes out in my fintech projects.
  - 📫 If you want to learn more about me lets link on Linkedin -> https://www.linkedin.com/in/munozovepi-gwata-037606126/

  🥳 Cannot wait to link my portfolio website and provide and update on my transition into tech!!
